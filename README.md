Mol2Context-vec:Learning molecular representation from context awareness for drug discovery

Mol2Context-vec provides a deep context aware molecular representation to drive the boundaries for drug discovery. It can integrate different levels of internal states to bring abundant molecular structure information.


Mol2Context-vec provides dynamic substructure representations to capture the local effects of the same substructure in different molecules. For substructures with ambiguity, the context vector generated by Mol2Context-vec correctly separates the different categories in the 3D space.
